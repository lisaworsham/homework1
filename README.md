# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

A (made up) client came to me to help make their website meets accessibility standards. It required me to take their existing code, refactor and make sure to futureproof it for them. I checked to make sure links were functioning correctly, organized the CSS so it followed the semantic structure of the HTML and made it so other developers can find what they need. Also I provided notes to clarify the sections.

## Prerequisites

```
Used Visual Studio Code and chrome's inspector tool 
```

## Process/What was Changed

```
Searched for all images and provided 'Alt Text' for all
Added reset.css style file to remove any browsers formatting
Located the different <div>'s and gave them proper HTML semantics
Added notes for each section
Reorganzied the CSS styles so they were in the same order as the HTML semantics
Divided them into corresponding CSS style files for quick reference
Compressed CSS styles so classes with same style formatting are referenced together
Renamed classes for the floats so you knew they were images. 
Added title to website
```

## Review

At first upon reviewing the code, I felt overwhelmed. I could see the disorganization and wasn't sure where to start first even though I had instructions to follow.
Eventually I took a step back and visualized previous activities and decided to work my way from top to bottom, dividing the sections of the website deciding what was what semantically and comparing it to w3schools.

I can see myself making more improvements as I learn more and become more familiar with web development. I will want to do this activity again 6 months from now and see what I would do differently.
